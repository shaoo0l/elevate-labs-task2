indicators found in this mail to think this is suspicious phishing mail:

1.Generic Greeting - Uses "Dear User" instead of the actual name. Legitimate services usually personalize emails.

2.practice of social engineering. “Your account is suspended.” and “update your payment details” are designed to create panic and rush. this is maily focused to manipulate human behaviour.

3.“UPDATE ACCOUNT” button is a classic lure to lead victims to fake login or payment pages. maybe contains an embedded link in this button.

4.Unusual Request for Personal Info - Legitimate companies rarely ask you to confirm billing info, phone number, and payment info all at once through email.

5.Brand Spoofing (Netflix Logo Misuse) - While it uses the Netflix logo, the overall formatting, spacing, and alignment are suspiciously off, not matching official branding standards.

6.No Recipients Email or Personal Info Visible - Real Netflix emails would usually include your name, last 4 digits of the card, or part of your account email for personalization.

7.Unknown Sender Address - the image doesn't show the full sender address, phishing emails often use fake or looks alike domains like netflix-support.com instead of netflix.com.

8.Lack of Legal or Contact Information - Genuine Netflix emails contain copyright, customer service contacts, or links to privacy policy and support all of which are missing here.

9.There are spelling and grammar mistakes throughout the email.

10.The customer's name is missing from the greeting and the “To:” field is completely blank, meaning the email was likely part of a larger phishing campaign sent to multiple email addresses.
